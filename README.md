**IXD FINAL YEAR IDEAS**

**Designers Collab.**

**Overview**

Collaborative Mobile application for designers to collaborate on projects together for an agreed percentage.

This will be a collaborative application for designers to collaborate on projects. If as a designer you lack certain skills to complete a project or a certain part of a project then this application would be useful for you. You can search this site for other designers who possess the skills for the project that you might lack.

For example: if you were required to produce a website for a client with a quick turnaround but the website required the use of JavaScript, you don&#39;t know how to use Javascript and don&#39;t have enough time to learn it, then you could use this application to find someone with the relevant skills to complete this project with you for an agreed percentage of the price.

I would imagine the interface of this to have an image of the person who you would potentially be employing and below that a selection of their work that they have completed in the past for you to look at. Contact information would then be displayed below this, with the option to instant message them through the app or call them direct to their phone for an even quicker response.

Their could also be a rating scheme for people to be rated based on their performance - this would work for both parties. The person who gets hired through the app is rated based on their performance and the work they produce and the person hiring using the app could be rated based on how quickly and fairly they pay the person they employ.

**Pros:**

Useful for people in our industry

Could be used across all art related industries (animation, painting, web design etc.)

A good way for people to get freelance work

Potential for repeat business with people you worked with before if you liked the work they produced.

**Cons:**

Could be a very simple idea to create

Unsure how to build a working app

Unsure about a lot of the aspect and how they would work.



**How might it be built:**

I think this site is most useful as an app however i&#39;m not sure how to create this, I do have basic skills in HTML and CSS and i am very willing to learn new skills to create a working application.

I am keen to challenge myself to create something I never have before. In this instance this project could be a good idea because there are lots of different techniques I would need to learn to create this.

**Who&#39;s it for:**

I think this application will be mainly used by people in the art industry who are looking for freelance work to complete in their free time.

This application will also be used by people who need to hire people for small parts of the projects they are completing.

**What is the business model** :

I imagine people who will use this app would be willing to pay a small fee for the use of it. There is also the opportunity for me to add a percentage fee to any work obtained through the app, this would take away the need for the initial fee to download the app, but still make money from this application by charging a small fee based on any work that is passed through the app.

**Puberty App**

**Overview**

Puberty app for young people only beginning puberty.

Going through puberty is something that everyone experiences in their lifetime, yet it&#39;s something a lot of people are scared to talk about. Therefore I want to build an app that will teach kids all about their bodies and what happens. Stopping all the immature rumours that go around about the subject. I want to be able to help those kids who are too afraid to talk to their parents about what&#39;s changing in their body and whether or not it&#39;s normal.

User will create an account and insert their age so they can only view content relevant to them. This will stop young people getting content they might not need to know yet.

This would be a puberty app for mobile devices. I will include animations to explain how certain things happen and how to perform certain tasks e.g. shaving, using a tampon etc.

I will focus on both male and female puberty as i believe in schools they only teach the girls about female puberty and the boys about male puberty, but i believe it may be more useful for kids to learn about both genders.

Inspiration for app icon could be the clue app icon, clue is a period tracker app that doesn&#39;t resemble anything to do with periods and for people who are embarrassed about it being on their homescreen people won&#39;t know what it is unless they have it too.

Could include potential audience interaction with short quizzes or questions to test they are understanding what they are reading if they get the answers wrong then there is a short explanation as to why it&#39;s wrong. If they answer correctly then they get a short answer why they are right. -- potentially leaderboard. I also think I need to have the option for the information to be read aloud for accessibility purposes.

I have also thought about furthering on into informing the user about intercourse and what to expect but also explain the potential risks involved (std&#39;s etc) and where they can go to get help with these.

I think I also want to include a print version of all the information in the app. I think i could do this through the use of AR where the user holds their phone over the book and diagrams move to show what changes in the body.

Can also include content about stis etc and explain symptoms of these and where to go to get help.

**Pros**

I have relative knowledge of some of these areas

Research can be conducted to find out the information i don&#39;t know

Relative knowledge of after effects to complete the animations

Links with college sexual health nurses from placement

Links with doctors who have said the app would be a great idea and can link me to the right people in the NHS to get this app certified when completed properly

Very useful for people of different ages

Illustrations and visual graphics might make this a lot easier for people to understand

The use of AR could help this information come to life for the user

**Cons**

Lots of work to do, will be a very busy year to get it all done properly - this is also a good thing of course.

Bit of a taboo subject - people dont like to talk about puberty or whats going on in their bodies

Could either deter people from reading it because of embarrassment

I need to be very aware of all the graphic images that i would be showing and how this might effect certain users and how parents might react

A lot of graphic content for me to be illustrating - all images need to look correct

**How it might be built**

I&#39;m unsure how to build a working app and would need to look into this properly. I also don&#39;t fully understand AR so would need to look into this.I do have basic skills in HTML and CSS and i am very willing to learn new skills to create a working application.

I am keen to challenge myself to create something I never have before. In this instance this project could be a good idea because there are lots of different techniques I would need to learn to create this. Including the workings of an app and AR. I also like the idea of a printed version through a book because it gives the users different ways to take the information.

**Who is it for**

This would mainly be used by pre-teens and teenagers who&#39;s bodies are changing or who maybe want to check over the information. Parents might also use this app to collect some information before they chat to their kids, or some parents might want to check over the information before they put it out to their kids.

**What is the business model**

I think this would be a free app to download but the book would be charged at Â£14.99.



**ABC with me -** (name in progress)

**Overview**

An app to help teach kids the alphabet, this would include a little character for each letter and an animation relating to each letter - &#39;A is for ants&#39;, the character is shaped like an A and ants will appear over the screen. I will have the character say their sentence and the animation happen for each letter.

I want the user to learn how to draw the letter too so they learn all the aspects of the letter. They will have to draw the letter on their smartphone or tablet device. I will also include how to say the letter, in primary schools today kids are learning what sounds each letter makes, therefore i would like the characters for each letter to demonstrate how each letter is said and then get the child to repeat it into the microphone.

I want to help children learn the alphabet in as many different ways as possible from their tablet or phone and show them how learning can be fun. Therefore i would like to include a game or activity to enhance the users experience using the app and make learning a bit more fun for them. Eg word searches, fill in the blanks etc. I could even have a spelling section where they learn how to spell the words using this letter.

Each character will come on the screen individually and teach the kid all about their letter and have different tests for each letter and the user cant progress to the next letter until they have learnt the previous one. This will help kids learn the alphabet in the correct order.

This app could be very useful for schools who are now integrating the use of tablets into their teaching. They could let the kids use this app to learn the letters whilst in class and then task them to go home and learn it on their personal devices at home so they are getting repeat information, this helps information stay in their heads.

Once certain characters have been completed then the user could buy the merchandise relating to that character e.g. wooden letters for their bedroom doors, teddy bears, posters

I also think I could have a written book for available for purchase where the child can hand write the letters out and colour in their favourite characters themselves, spell out their name etc.

Although alphabet apps have been done before i think this is something that i could create to a much higher standard and make it more interactive for the users to help them learn properly.

I can also get in touch with a number of local primary schools to see how they are teaching kids the alphabet and what techniques they find help the kids learn properly. This way if my app directly links with how kids are being taught then it might be more appealing for schools to get involved and get their kids to use this in the classroom and outside of it.

**Pros**

Very useful app for kids

Uses a good amount of illustration which I think is one of my strong points

I have good use of illustrator and photoshop for illustrations and images

As well as a good knowledge of after effects for animations

Every child needs to learn the alphabet so why not make it fun for them and exciting to learn

Characters for each letter makes it more personal as the user can remember a characters name for each letter (Annie Apple) both her names start with A

Puzzles will help the information store with the child

I&#39;m good at designing products aimed at a younger audience, I&#39;ve worked with a lot of kids in the past

Very useful for my future aspired career as a teacher

Lots of different ways for me to help kids learn the letters of the alphabet (saying it out loud into a microphone, animations relating to that letter, drawing the letter, characters relating to the letter)

**Cons**

I&#39;ve never built a working app before so this would be a new challenge for me

Animations for every letter could prove difficult

Lots of illustrations - could there be too much

Alphabet has been done before so it would need to be done well for it to be the best app

**How it is built**

I&#39;m not sure how I would build this application but i will put in the research and practise to learn how to do it properly

I also have knowledge of after effect and illustrator etc but I am willing to put in the work to learn any new techniques I may need

**Who is it for**

This app is aimed at young kids 4-8 to teach them the letters of the alphabet. I need to be aware of the language I use and the sizing of letters and images etc

I also need to be aware of accessibility and include the use of subtitles when the characters are speaking

**The business model**

This would be a free app but I think I could include a store for people to shop for the characters in different forms, eg wooden letters of the characters for the child&#39;s bedroom doors

Puzzle books that children can actually write in relating to the characters and the information they are being taught
